## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My Name is Damien, I am 45 and is a long time resident in the technical realm. 
This isnt my first go at coding, but its been a very long time. 
Currently enrolled at UNI trying to get a bit more relevant, excluding fashion ofcourse. 

If not by my screens, im out walking my dog or reading a crime novel.
